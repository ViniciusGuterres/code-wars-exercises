# Problem description:

    Lisa just got a new math workbook.
    A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters.
    
    Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's located.
    The format of Lisa's book is as follows:

        * There are n chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from 1 to n.

        * The iÂ° chapter has arr[i] problems, numbered from 1 to arr[i].

        * Each page can hold up to k problems. Only a chapter's last page of exercises may contain fewer than k problems.

        * Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.

        * The page number indexing starts at 1.

    Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of special problems?


# Example:

    arr = [4, 2]

    k = 3


    Function params:
        * int n: the number of chapters

        * int k: the maximum number of problems per page
        
        * int arr[n]: the number of problems in each chapter
