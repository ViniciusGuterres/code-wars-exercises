# Problem description:

    Taum is planning to celebrate the birthday of his friend, Diksha.
    There are two types of gifts that Diksha wants from Taum: one is black and the other is white.
     
    To make her happy, Taum has to buy "b" black gifts and "w" white gifts.

    * The cost of each black gift is "bc" units.

    * The cost of every white gift is "wc" units.

    * The cost to convert a black gift into white gift or vice versa is "z" units.

    Determine the minimum cost of Diksha's gifts.

# Example:

    b = 3

    w = 5

    bc = 3

    wc = 4

    z = 1

    He can buy a black gift for 3 and convert it to a white gift for 1, making the total cost of each white gift 4.
 
    That matches the cost of a white gift, so he can do that or just buy black gifts and white gifts. Either way, the overall cost is .

    3 * 3 + 5 * 4 = 29

    result = 29
