# Challenge description:
    There is a strange counter. At the first second, it displays the number 3.

    Each second, the number displayed by decrements by 1 until it reaches 1. In next second, the timer resets to 2x the initial number for the prior cycle and continues counting down.
    
    The diagram below shows the counter values for each time t in the first three cycles:


    Find and print the value displayed by the counter at time t.
